Git branches demo folder

##TIPS

- When we clone a repo to our local device, both projects are already connected --> when we push code from local to remote, the code knows where to go!

```zsh
git clone sshKey
```

- Then, to push files to GitHub

```zsh
git add .
```

or if a specific folder

```zsh
git add folderName
```
